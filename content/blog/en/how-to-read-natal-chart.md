# How to Read Your Natal Chart: Complete Beginner's Guide from A to Z

A natal chart (or birth chart) is a cosmic "snapshot" of the sky at the moment of your birth. It shows the positions of planets, zodiac signs, and astrological houses at the exact moment you took your first breath.

This is your unique cosmic DNA that reveals:
- Your personality and talents
- Life challenges and lessons
- Relationships and career
- Spiritual path and purpose

## What You Need to Get Started

To build your natal chart, you'll need:

1. **Birth Date** (day, month, year)
2. **Exact Birth Time** (hours and minutes) - very important!
3. **Birth Place** (city, country)

**Why is time important?** The Ascendant and house positions change every 4 minutes! Even a 10-minute difference can significantly alter the interpretation.

**Where to find exact time?** Check your birth certificate or ask your parents.

### 3. Houses (WHERE)
